2. Board size side: 13-51  
3. Square board  
4. At the beginning, always 10% of the random fields occupied, size 1x1  
5. Opposite edges are neighbors  
6. Prepare the folder with the album number eg: 012345 in this folder the executive file eg .exe, .jar etc.… with the name is the album number eg: 012345.exe. In the same folder, an info.txt file containing 3 lines:  
(1) alias

7. Programs will be started on the computer with sys windows  
8. Nothing can be installed  
9. Cannot use the random function  
10. Steps:  
a. s-> n e.g.: 15 // board size  
b. p-> ok // respond program  
c. s-> {x1; y1}, {x2; y2}, {x3; y3} ... // pre-occupied fields  
d. p. ok  
e. s-> {x1; y1}, {x2; y2} or start // start - starts or as the second  
f. p -> {x1; y1}, {x2; y2}  
g. s -> {x1; y1}, {x2; y2}  
h. p -> {x1; y1}, {x2; y2}
